# Nightly Journal

Append-only log, newest first. One short entry per run: date, issue, PR, CI
result, what worked, what to try next.

## 2026-06-07 — M0 bootstrap (setup, human)

- **Done:** Repo scaffolded — workspace (`ocpi-types`, `ocpi-client`,
  `ocpi-server`, `ocpi-cli`), strict CI + security, owner-trust governance,
  vendored specs, this nightly substrate. All local gates green.
- **State:** M0 complete. M1 issues seeded for the routine to pick up.
- **Next:** Start M1 — flesh out the OCPI response envelope edge cases, the full
  common-types set, and transport headers/pagination. Then M2 (Versions +
  Credentials handshake) toward the first `v0.1.0` release.
